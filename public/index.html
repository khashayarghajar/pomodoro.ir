          The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used
          for any task. For many people, time is an enemy. The anxiety triggered
          by “the ticking clock”, especially when it involves a deadline, leads
          to ineffective work and study habits which in turn lead to
          procrastination. The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a
          valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want
          to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work or
          study.
